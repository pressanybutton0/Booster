"""Motion controller that combines avoidance, walking control, and kick commands.

The controller translates "where to go" into a :class:`RobotCommand` while
keeping path detours, yaw-avoidance bias, and unicycle walking control together.
It is a reactive controller with no global path planning: each tick computes
detour points from current obstacles and outputs velocity directly.

The biped base is most stable with ``vx + vyaw`` commands. Lateral ``vy`` is
left at zero in combined movement commands, so avoidance is split into path
detours that change the target and yaw avoidance that changes angular velocity.

PLAY and READY share walking parameters. The remaining phase difference is the
``avoid_opponents`` flag: off for PLAY, on for READY and recovery paths.
