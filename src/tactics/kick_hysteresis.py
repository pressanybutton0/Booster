"""Extract the implicit kick mini-state-machine from ``soccer_strategy.py`` into a pure model.

The old implementation used two dicts, ``_soccer_kick_active`` and
``_soccer_kick_far_since``, to track whether each player was kicking. This replaces
that with an explicit state machine:

Each ``player_id`` owns one :class:`PlayerKickState`.
The ``IsInKickRange`` condition queries :meth:`KickHysteresis.in_kick_range`.
The ``KickBall`` action marks state active via :meth:`KickHysteresis.mark_kicking`.
``ApproachBall`` clears state through :meth:`KickHysteresis.clear_player`.

Enter/exit thresholds and delay come from ``SoccerConfig.strategy``. Competitors
can read this file to understand why stepping slightly away from the ball does not
immediately leave the kicking state.
