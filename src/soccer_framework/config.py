Competitor-facing tuning knobs live here: field dimensions, robot names, kick

:meth:`SoccerConfig.from_env` loads per-match config from env vars such as

separate host-deployment config for scripts and is not consumed by the runtime process.

The environment surface is intentionally limited to fields competitors must change
