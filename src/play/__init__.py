"""PLAY-stage strategy package and template core.

Competitors mainly inspect this package for the default Playbook, role strategy
base classes, shared utility nodes, dynamic roles, the Playbook registry, and
the PLAY subtree shape with rule guards and role branches.

All roles extend :class:`RoleStrategy`; the required contract is
:meth:`RoleStrategy.build_subtree`. Pure positioning roles can use a single
:class:`MoveToTarget` leaf, and conditional kicking roles can use
:func:`build_attack_subtree`.
